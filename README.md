# mOS Schema

A place to collect various common data and documentation for the Milady OS project.

Here's what I plan to collect here:

**Todo:**

* A declaration for how to store and reference accessories and components
* A JSON file that associates every accessory ID with:
  * type ("hat") and variant ("trucker gothic milady") of accessory
  * Bonding curve parameter and/or original supply amount
* Reference rendering script written in Python
* All "component" assets (i.e. all components needed to render an Avatar from the ground up). This includes accessories.
